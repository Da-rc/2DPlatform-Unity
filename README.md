# About The game

It's a classic 2D platform in which the player have to collect items to gain points. The game have 3 different levels and 3 lives to complete them, if the player lose the 3 lives, they will have to start over again.
If the player finish the game or dies, they will have the option to write a name and save their points in a database (Firebase) and then they can see the top 5 players on a leaderboard.
